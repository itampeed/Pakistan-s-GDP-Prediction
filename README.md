# GDP Growth Prediction for Pakistan using Polynomial Regression

## Overview
In the dynamic field of data science, predicting economic trends is a crucial skill with broad implications. This project focuses on forecasting Pakistan's GDP growth from 2024 to 2040, employing advanced data analysis techniques, specifically Polynomial Regression.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib geopandas
```

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itampeed/pakistan-s-gdp-prediction
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Download the dataset file "Annual_GDP_of_Countries.csv" from [World Bank Economy Forum](your-dataset-link) and place it in the project root directory.

4. Open a terminal and run the main script:
   ```bash
   python gdp_prediction.py
   ```

   This will execute the code and generate visualizations of Pakistan's GDP growth predictions using Polynomial Regression. The script also includes a geospatial representation of GDP growth rates on the world map.

## Libraries Used
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn: Machine learning tools, including the implementation of Polynomial Regression
- matplotlib: Plotting and visualization
- geopandas: Geospatial data manipulation and mapping

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, "Annual_GDP_of_Countries.csv," is sourced from World Bank Economy Forum. It includes GDP data for more than 100 countries from 1960 to 2022.

## Future Directions
This project lays the foundation for further exploration, including the incorporation of additional economic indicators, model refinement, and expanding the geographical scope for a more comprehensive analysis.
